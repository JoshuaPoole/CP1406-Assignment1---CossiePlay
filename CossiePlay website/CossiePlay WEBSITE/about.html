<h2> About </h2>
CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes.From simple Spiderman costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. We also buy and sell second-hand costumes.
On the first saturday of every month we hold a Cosplay party at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).
