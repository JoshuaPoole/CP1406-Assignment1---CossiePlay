<h2> What is CosPlay? </h2>
</section>
<p> Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is performance art in which participants wear costumes to represent a character. Favourite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series.
The rapid growth of numbers of cosplay hobbyists since 1990 has created a popular cosplay culture in Japan and in some parts of Asia and the Western world. There are Cosplay fan conventions and also dedicated local and international competitions, social networks, websites and other forms of media centred on cosplay activities.</p>
